/**
 * A controller that emits events when a feature is clicked.
 * Note that this controller will *not* select features. You can use the default map selection behavior for that.
 *
 * As an example, this controller is used with panoramas to enter/move in a panorama when its icon is clicked.
 *
 * This controller fires event when a feature from one of its layers was clicked.
 * You can listen to click events as follows:
 *
 * <code>
 *   const logClick = (feature, layer, gestureEvent) => {
 *     console.log(`Clicked on feature with ID: ${feature.id} from layer ${layer.label} at mouse [${gestureEvent.x}, ${gestureEvent.y}]`);
 *   }
 *   const clickController = new FeatureClickController([myFeatureLayer]);
 *   clickController.on(FEATURE_CLICKED, logClick);
 *   map.controller = clickController;
 * </code>
